A Kaggle competition notebook which includes EDA, ML models. 

Loan Approval Prediction System
Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict loan approval decisions using applicant financial and personal data. This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning implementation, from data preprocessing through model deployment, with a focus on financial services automation.
Technical Implementation
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values using fillna() with mode for categorical and mean for numerical features
Performed categorical encoding using LabelEncoder
Implemented feature scaling with StandardScaler
Applied outlier detection and handling
Features analyzed included:

Personal: Gender, Marital Status, Dependencies
Financial: Income, Credit History, Loan Amount
Property: Area, Property Type



Exploratory Data Analysis

Conducted comprehensive univariate and bivariate analysis
Created visualization suite using seaborn and matplotlib including:

Distribution plots for numerical features
Correlation heatmaps
Bar plots for categorical variables
Relationship analysis between features and loan approval



Machine Learning Pipeline

Implemented multiple models for comparison:

XGBoost Classifier
Random Forest
Logistic Regression


Applied K-fold Cross Validation for robust model evaluation
Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Feature importance analysis to identify key decision factors

Technical Stack
